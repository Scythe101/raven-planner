	Introduction to Calculus focuses on the foundations and analysis of early material students will
	encounter in a college level pre-calculus and calculus classes. Through the context of calculus,
	students will strengthen their skills in solving equations, graphing functions, and analyzing
	features of functions and their graphs. This course provides a review of polynomials,
	exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. Each family of functions will include an
	exploration of related limits and derivatives. Students will have the opportunity to begin
	exploring integrals at the conclusion of the course.
