<h2 class="mt-8">Prerequisites</h2>
<p class=" text-xl">
	Students should have a “D” or higher in Integrated Math 1. This non-college-preparatory course is designed
for students who need additional supports for success in Integrated Math 2.
</p>

<p class="mt-4 mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Below are some guidelines for choosing the best course for an individual student. This is not a
	placement test and it should not be used as the only criteria for making placement decisions.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-8">Student Background</h2>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Students entering Integrated Math 1/2 Essentials should <strong>already</strong> have a good understanding of the
following concepts:
</p>
<ul class="font-noto-serif mr-4 ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	<li>Understand the connection between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.</li>
	<li>Solving linear equations as well as apply graphical and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables.</li>
	<li>Understanding arithmetic and geometric sequences and their relationship to linear and exponential functions.</li>
	<li>Defining, evaluating, and comparing functions, and use them to model relationships among quantities.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations</li>
	<li>Understanding congruence using transformational geometry.</li>
	<li>Solving real-world and mathematical problems using linear mathematical models.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-8">Course Content and Expectations</h2>
<p class=" mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	In Integrated Math 1/2 Essentials, students will learn concepts such as:
</p>

<ul class="font-noto-serif mr-4 ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	<li>Manipulating algebraic expressions, including rearranging, collecting terms, factoring, applying properties of exponents, and transforming expression between different forms.</li>
	<li>Understanding properties of quadratics (roots, vertices, forms, intervals of increasing/decreasing, end behavior, etc.)</li>
	<li>Understanding the concept of a function, domain, and range, and identifying properties of functions and graphs.</li>
	<li>Interpreting functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally.</li>
	<li>Modeling with functions using tables, functions, and understanding when the context allows for a model that is only an approximation.</li>
	<li>Constructing and comparing linear, exponential, and quadratic models to solve real-life problems.</li>
	<li>Writing, interpreting, and translating among various forms of quadratic equations.</li>
	<li>Using similarity to define and solve problems using right-triangle trigonometry.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="text-xl">
	Students will be expected to work collaboratively as well as individually. On a regular basis,
	classes will include:
</p>
<ul class="font-noto-serif mr-4 ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	<li>Group problem solving followed by group and/or individual presentations.</li>
	<li>Open ended problems that are applications of the content being covered.</li>
	<li>Challenge problems, which may consist of detailed diagrams and a single page write-up.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-xl mb-4">This course is a below grade level course which may also have an individualized remediation
component.</p>
