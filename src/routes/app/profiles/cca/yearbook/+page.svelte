<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Yearbook is an exciting course where students have the opportunity to practice communication, management, problem solving, writing, photography, and graphic design. Students will work toward mastery in journalistic skills like interviewing, copywriting, and editing, while also learning the basics of design as they create layouts, work with typography, and choose images to communicate a message. Students also have the ability to learn and practice photography in many settings including stage events, sports, candids, and portraits. Student press law is taught along with ethical responsibilities that journalism in all forms requires. Teamwork is expected, as is self-directed learning. This is a course that requires students to be independently driven while being strong collaborators, working together with the team to achieve goals that lead to creating a successful real world product.
