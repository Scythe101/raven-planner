<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	English 12 is a one-term course focused around a structured "Senior Project" where students
	identify their interests and pursue their goals through research, writing, and community
	participation. Students will also be given instruction, guidance, and time to construct/develop
	their college essays—preparing the student for their upcoming college Freshmen Composition
	classes. Students will read major works, such as Shakespeare, short stories, poetry, and seminar
	novels while infusing mythological and literary allusions. Students will use critical thinking
	skills and apply them to assignments and projects given in class. Students will work in
	cooperative-learning groups in which they share ideas and concepts from the works read in class.
	Students will leave this class prepared for college and business reading, writing, and speaking
	challenges.
