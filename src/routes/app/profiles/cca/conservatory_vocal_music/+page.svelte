<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	The Vocal Conservatory is an audition-based, after-school extension of the daytime Envision program, offering smaller class sizes and more individualized instruction for the most advanced vocal students.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Vocal Conservatory singers focus on developing a strong and educated singing voice. Students are exposed to many different types of singing, including, but not limited to: jazz, improvisation, opera, art songs, classical, blues, rock, voice painting, and even song writing. Conservatory students perform in solo work as well as small ensembles. They also take classes in music theory and history.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	The collaborative nature of the arts ensures that Conservatory students enjoy many opportunities to work with and learn from one another. A focus on interdisciplinary collaboration is best witnessed during the three-week, Conservatory-wide class called the Projects. The Projects put all Conservatory students on interdisciplinary teams of twelve to fifteen artists. Teams are facilitated by a CCA/Envision teacher, and each year a new theme is selected to unite all the Projects. Examples of such themes include “Beginnings” and “Dreams.” At the end of the three weeks, each team must present their Project (a publication, performance, exhibit, etc.) to the entire CCA school community.
