<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Digital Media Production will give students with advanced video production skills the opportunity
	to produce content for school-based productions and independently pursue longer-format video
	projects. As part of the course, each student will produce content for the CCA Daily Bulletin in
	addition to shooting and editing school events and promotional materials. This course is a great
	opportunity for students considering applying to film school to create content for their portfolio
	and screen their work on a daily basis.
