<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	This course is designed for all dance levels and allows students to fulfill both their PE and Health course requirements for graduation. Designed to build studentsâ€™ dance skills through participation in exercises in technique, dance combinations, and choreography, students will learn fundamental skills and be introduced to increasingly complex and demanding movements. Students gain an overview of the world of dance which includes the fundamentals and terminology of ballet, jazz, modern, hip hop as well as a solid foundation of understanding in body alignment, placement and articulation. Focus of movement is on quality and accuracy of movement, rather than difficulty or speed. Dancers perform in an All-Envision dance production toward the end of the semester. All information pertaining to performance dates and expectations will be outlined in the semester syllabus. Students will complete their Physical Education Fitness testing which includes curl ups, push ups, flexibility and mile run. Students will complete the majority of the "Health Education" portion of the class online and will complete Health Education exams on campus with their PE teacher at designated times over the course of the term.
