	Below are some guidelines for choosing the best course for an individual student. This is not a
	placement test and it should not be used as the only criteria for making placement decisions.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-8">Student Background</h2>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Students entering Integrated Math 3 Honors should already have a good understanding
	of the following concepts:
</p>
<ul class="font-noto-serif mr-4 ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	<li>Understanding properties of linear, exponential and quadratic functions.</li>
	<li>Graphing and describing features of linear, exponential and quadratic functions.</li>
	<li>Defining, evaluating, and comparing functions, and use them to model relationships among quantities.</li>
	<li>Knowing and proving properties of lines, triangles, quadrilaterals and circles.</li>
	<li>Solving real-world and mathematical problems using linear, exponential, and quadratic mathematical models.</li>
	<li>Understanding and applying right triangle trigonometry and the special right triangles.</li>
	<li>Understanding and calculating probability for independent and dependent events.</li>
	<li>Understanding unit circle trigonometry and radian measures of angles.</li>
	<li>Graphing and modeling with logarithmic functions.</li>
	<li>Proving and applying properties of logarithmic functions and inverse functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-8">Course Content and Expectations</h2>
<p class=" mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	In Integrated Math 3 Honors, students will learn concepts such as:

	Students will be expected to work collaboratively as well as individually. On a regular basis,
	classes will include:
</p>
<ul class="font-noto-serif mr-4 mb-4 ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	<li>Group problem solving followed by group and/or individual presentations.</li>
	<li>Open ended problems that are applications of the content being covered.</li>
	<li>Challenge problems, which may consist of detailed diagrams and presentations.</li>
</ul>
