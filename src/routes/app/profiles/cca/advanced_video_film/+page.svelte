	Advanced Video/Film is an Envision Cinema class that provides students with hands-on experiences
	in video production. This course is designed for students who have completed the introductory
	Video/Film course and have an interest in the television, video, film, or other communication
	professions. Students in the class work together as a real-world production studio to film and
	edit video content largely geared toward, but not limited to, our weekly campus broadcast, CCA-TV,
	which covers various community activities and stories.

	As an SDUHSD Career Technical Education (CTE) course, Advanced Video/Film prepares students with
	skills that translate directly to future working opportunities in the film industry and for
	further study at the college level.
