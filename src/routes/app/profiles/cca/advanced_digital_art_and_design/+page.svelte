<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Advanced Digital Art and Design should be taken after Digital Art and Design (Imaging). The Advanced Digital Art and Design course is built to enhance studentâ€™s understanding of digital image making processes and advance design thinking skills through a myriad of projects that include photo-bashing techniques, concept art, commercial graphic design, identity branding, and many more. Through thoughtful real world exercises and projects, visiting artists, and intensive workshops, advanced Imaging students develop a critical eye and understanding of how images and design work on us in culture, and how images, graphics and products are used to entertain, inform, and influence humans at all levels. Advanced Digital Art and Design is geared towards students who are interested in further developing their individual digital art and collaborative design skills. Students will be encouraged to work within the community to solve design problems and to engage in professional practices. In addition, Advanced Digital Art and Design students deepen and refine their skill with computers, cameras, Photoshop, Illustrator, and industry standard technology available to realize their creative vision. This is a project-based class and success is determined by the effort each student is willing to commit to the creative process. This class emphasizes professional practice and includes longer term projects in collaboration with outside organizations. This class emulates a professional design studio and tackles a diverse array of design problems throughout the semester. This class has a highly collaborative environment and it is imperative that students taking advanced imaging are not only proficient, but are also willing to participate fully in the group discussions, critiques, and evaluations.
