	This course is a continuation of American Sign Language I and emphasizes refinement of the
	fundamental comprehension and production skills covered in ASL I, with the acquisition of
	additional vocabulary and grammatical structure. It is designed to build receptive skills, learn
	to communicate through context, and develop strategies for figuring out meaning and to build upon
	that foundation. In addition to learning the language, this course will focus upon the knowledge
	of the Deaf community and the development of the cultural awareness necessary for communication
	and interaction.

	clarification; describe the physical appearance of others; explain needs and make requests; talk
	about family and occupations; and describe basic activities in which they are involved.
