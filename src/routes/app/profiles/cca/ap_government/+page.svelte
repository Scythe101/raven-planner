<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Beginning in Fall 2018, the newly redesigned APÂ® U.S. Government and Politics Curriculum
	Framework combines disciplinary skills with a deep understanding of political concepts. In this
	way the course not only aligns with a one-semester introductory college course in U.S. government,
	but also prepares students for advanced political science coursework and active, informed
	participation in our constitutional democracy.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	AP United States Government and Politics is a college-level introduction to key political
	concepts, ideas, institutions, policies, interactions, roles, and behaviors that characterize the
	constitutional system and political culture of the United States. Students will read and analyze
	U.S. foundational documents, Supreme Court decisions, and other texts and visuals to gain an
	understanding of the relationships and interactions between political institutions and behavior.
	They will read and interpret data, develop evidence-based arguments, and engage in an applied
	civics or politics research-based project.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	The AP U.S. Government and Politics Curriculum Framework is composed of two sections: "Political
	Science Skills and Practices" and the "Content Outline."
</p>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	The content outline is organized around five big ideas, which focus on major concepts in U.S.
	government and politics. Within each big idea, a number of enduring understandings (EUs) focus on
	specific aspects of the big idea and delineate the level of conceptual understanding required of
	successful AP students in this course.
</p>

<h3 class="font-dm-serif-display mt-4 text-2xl italic">Course Units</h3>
<ul class="font-noto-serif ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl">
	<li>Foundations of American Democracy</li>
	<li>Interaction Among Branches of Government</li>
	<li>Civil Liberties and Civil Rights</li>
	<li>American Political Ideologies and Beliefs</li>
	<li>Political Participation</li>
</ul>

<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Foundational documents and Supreme Court cases are an integral part of the course and necessary
	for students to understand the philosophical underpinnings, significant legal precedents, and
	political values of the U.S. political system and may serve as the focus of AP Exam questions. The
	course requires study of:
</p>
<ul class="font-noto-serif ml-6 list-outside list-disc text-xl">
	<li>9 foundational documents, including the U.S. Constitution</li>
	<li>15 landmark Supreme Court cases</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="font-dm-serif-display mt-4 text-2xl italic">
	Political Science Research or Applied Civics Project
</h3>
<p class="mr-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	The required project adds a civic component to the course, engaging students in exploring how they
	can affect, and are affected by, government and politics throughout their lives. The project might
	have students collect data on a teacher-approved political science topic, participate in a
	community service activity, or observe and report on the policymaking process of a governing body.
	Students should plan a presentation that relates their experiences or findings to what they are
	learning in the course.
