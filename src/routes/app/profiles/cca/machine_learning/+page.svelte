<h2 class="mt-8">Course Description</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Informatics, or “data science,” and the use of Artificial Intelligence technologies is growing rapidly in our society. Applications include self-driving cars, personal assistants, product recommendations, robotics, data analysis, and web searching. These applications involve self-learning systems trained on large amounts of data and intelligence based on algorithms.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	This semester course provides students exposure to the field of informatics, via problem-solving applied to fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining/Analysis, and Social Computing. Students explore creative applications of algorithms to a wide range of real-world challenges in math, science, language, and art. Projects concentrate on developing interdisciplinary applications of information science, especially in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on the design and implementation of intelligent agents that perform tasks with some degree of autonomy.
</p>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Students will acquire the fundamentals of programming in Python to develop applications capable of retrieving, searching, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying data. Students gain competency and fluency with the vocabulary of algorithms, informatics, big data, and artificial intelligence through exposure to a variety of sources and perspectives. They will develop critical thinking, problem solving, computational thinking, effective communication, and teamwork skills. Students will express their understanding of legal, policy, and ethical factors through class discussion, research, and presentations.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-8">Grading</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	A variety of assessments will be used including journal entries, projects and self and peer assessments. For example, students will be assessed on their journal entries which include warm-up exercises to the 3dB point on a filter. Another example assessment includes student demonstration of a project implementing the combinatorial logic associated with a fire alarm. Another example assessment includes a student self-evaluation of the design of his or her sequential timer. Another example assessment includes peer review and voting of students’ final class project.

<h2 class="mt-8">Workload & Class Setting</h2>
<p class="mr-4 mb-4 text-xl 2xl:w-3/4">
	Work load: (High, Medium, Low)<br>
	Class setting: This relates directly to how much the student is expected to work independently or in a group requiring self-initiated work, problem solving, etc versus and highly guided and structured class. (Highly independent, Moderately Independent, Structured). Hands-on projects accompany each unit.<br>
	<i>*Each year all CTE courses are reviewed by industry professionals within the pathway to ensure the most current, relevant experience for our students.</i>
